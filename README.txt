A simple Share-on-Steemit button

All you need to put a simple share-on-Steemit button on a web page. Just put everything in a directory together somewhere and the example.html should work; you can put the DIV and its contents from the example in your own webpage.

Note that: - there may be a newer version of steem.min.js on Github;
           - the user must enter their private publishing key, not any other key;
           - there is only minimal input checking;
           - the categories/tags of the posting made are hardcoded in shareonsteemit.js; you may want to change them;
           - the slugifier that makes the permlink only does Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic alphabets;
           - a preview of the posting is activated by editing the body of the posting.

If you feel like donating for this, you can do so here: ocrdu.nl/donations. The share-on-Steemit button can be seen on that page as well (but it is a dedicated version).
