A simple Share-on-Steemit button

All you need to put a simple share-on-Steemit button on a web page. Just put everything in a directory together somewhere and the example.html should work; you can put the DIV and its contents from the example in your own webpage.

Note: - that there may be a newer version of steem.min.js on Github;
      - that the user must enter their private publishing key, not any other key;
      - that there is only minimal input checking;
	  - that the categories/tags of the posting made are hardcoded in shareonsteemit.js; you may want to change them.

If you feel like donating for this, you can do so here: ocrdu.nl/donations. The share-on-Steemit button can be seen on that page as well.
